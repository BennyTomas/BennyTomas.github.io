<h2>Nanumo to you</h2>
	<p>Don't think of Nanumo as chain restaurant but more of a community of chefs wanting to show their culture to people in the form of food. Yes every restaurant will have the delicious core menu items perfected by owner Chef Benny, but each restaurant/food truck will have a team of very talented chefs that have control of the menu with the goal of throwing their cultural flare as well as ingredients most abundant to them in their region.</p>

<h3>Our food</h3>
	<p>Saying we serve filipino fusion is not the right meaning for our food because filipino food is already a blend of different cultures to begin with. What we really serve to the public is food that makes you feel good.</p>

<h3>What we offer</h3>

<h4>
	<p>Asian marinated chicken tenders with a sweet chili sauce</p>
	<p><a href="index.html"><img src="images/friedchicken.jpg" alt="home cooked meal"/></a></p>
	<p>Chicken stir fry with a bed of jasmine rice</p>
	<p><a href="index.html"><img src="images/stirfry.jpg" alt="home cooked meal"/></a></p>
	<p>Roasted garlic and chili flake alfredo with a spice butter based salmon</p>
