<h2>History</h2>
	<p>The Nanumo brand as a whole started off as nothing but a mere thought. All it took was a young college student to go all in. In 2021, Chef Benny made his dream into a reality by launching his first food truck. The food truck was revolutionary in becoming one of the first filipino inspired food trucks in the mid-west, while being publicly know to have the freshest and best tasting food in the area. From there the Nanumo brand exploded, opening multiple food trucks and restaurants. Despite having everything they could have imagined, the organization never forgets their humble roots and doesn't shy away from keeping things simple.</p>

<h3>How filipino food came to be</h3>
	<p>The conditions in the Philippines were not the best during throughout history. For decades, the Philippines were concurred by countries like China and Spain while the people from the region had to find food for themselves. To put it blunt the people of the Philippines were scrap eaters, eating anything and everything while having little to no waste. By not having the best quality ingredients, the people there would do whatever they could to make the food enjoyable... and that they did. The people kept things simple while combining flavors and ingredients from each of the countries that concurred them in the past to create their own style of food.</p>

<h3>Filipino Flavor</h3>
	<p>With the cooking being so simple, this means you can taste and savor every single ingredient individually. The distinction of flavor and taste compares to no other. One of the main profiles in the Philippines is sour, so the people of the region cook with a lot of vinegar and citrus. Not only does sour hit a different note in terms of flavor, but also keeps things lighter and on the healthier side. This sour hit along side utilizing every spice imaginable to create something wonderful.</p>
